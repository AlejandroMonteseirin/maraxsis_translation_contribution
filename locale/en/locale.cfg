[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
h2o-maraxsis=Welcome to [planet=maraxsis]. This planet is fully covered by water and there are no islands. Without a submarine, you will drown in two minutes. The three biomes are ocean plains, coral reef, and deepsea trench. Explore Maraxsis for all 6 quarkals to craft the [item=h2o-heart-of-the-sea] and [item=h2o-hydraulic-science-pack].
h2o-quantum-coraldynamics=QCD (quantum-coraldynamics) is used to create [item=h2o-heart-of-the-sea] via color confinement.\n\nThere are 6 quarkals:\n	- [item=h2o-up-coral]\n	- [item=h2o-down-coral]\n	- [item=h2o-top-coral]\n	- [item=h2o-bottom-coral]\n	- [item=h2o-strange-coral]\n	- [item=h2o-charm-coral]\n\nEach of these are combined in the [entity=h2o-quantum-computer].\nThere are 2^6-2 = 62 diffrent possible combinations.\n\nThe correct combination is randomized and unknown. It must be determined by an experiment.\nTo preform an experiment, add your quarkals to the [entity=h2o-quantum-computer] and provide 100 [fluid=brackish-water] to catalyze it.\nDuring a correct experiment a [item=h2o-heart-of-the-sea] is created and the secret combination will re-randomize.\n\nThe correct combination can be represented as a binary number where each quarkal is a bit.\nFor example if the secret was 101100 then the correct combination would be\n[item=h2o-up-coral] [item=h2o-top-coral] [item=h2o-bottom-coral].\n\nA failed experiment will generate some data about this hidden bit representation.\n\n[item=h2o-up-coral]:\n	You have matched more bits than the previous experiment.\n\n[item=h2o-down-coral]:\n	You have matched less bits than the previous experiment.\n\n[item=limestone]:\n	You have matched the same amount of bits as the previous experiment.\n	Limestone is always returned during the first experiment.\n\nNote that a secret combination of 000000 or 111111 is impossible.\nMultiple [entity=h2o-quantum-computer] will have separate and unrelated correct combinations.
h2o-trench-exploration=Occasionally while exploring Maraxsis you may find a deep gash in the planet's crust. This gash drops thousands of kilometers to an underwater trench. While above the trench, use __CONTROL__toggle-driving__ inside a [item=h2o-diesel-submarine] to decend. The deepsea trench is a dangerous place. It is completely dark and you will need [technology=h2o-torpedoes] to defend yourself. You will be crushed instantly without the protection of a [item=h2o-diesel-submarine] or a [item=h2o-nuclear-submarine]. Traveling two meters inside a trench corresponds to travelling only one meter on the surface.
h2o-underwater-machines=[entity=chemical-plant], [entity=h2o-hydro-plant], and [entity=h2o-quantum-computer] are sealed and designed for use under pressure.
