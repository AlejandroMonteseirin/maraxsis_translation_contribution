h2o-quantum-coraldynamics=QCD (quantum-coraldynamics) is used to create [item=h2o-heart-of-the-sea] via color confinement.\n\nThere are 6 quarkals:\n	- [item=h2o-up-coral]\n	- [item=h2o-down-coral]\n	- [item=h2o-top-coral]\n	- [item=h2o-bottom-coral]\n	- [item=h2o-strange-coral]\n	- [item=h2o-charm-coral]\n\nEach of these are combined in the [entity=h2o-quantum-computer].\nThere are 2^6-1 = 63 diffrent possible combinations.\n\nThe correct combination is randomized and unknown. It must be determined by an experiment.\nTo preform an experiment, add your quarkals to the [entity=h2o-quantum-computer] and provide 50 [fluid=chlorine] to catalyze it.\nDuring a correct experiment a [item=h2o-heart-of-the-sea] is created and the secret combination will re-randomize.\n\nThe correct combination can be represented as a binary number where each quarkal is a bit.\nFor example if the secret was 101100 then the correct combination would be\n[item=h2o-up-coral] [item=h2o-top-coral] [item=h2o-bottom-coral].\n\nA failed experiment will generate some data about this hidden bit representation.\n\n[item=h2o-up-coral]:\n	You have matched more bits than the previous experiment.\n\n[item=h2o-down-coral]:\n	You have matched less bits than the previous experiment.\n\n[item=limestone]:\n	You have matched the same amount of bits as the previous experiment.\n	Limestone is always returned during the first experiment.\n\nNote that a combination of 000000 is impossible.\nMultiple [entity=h2o-quantum-computer] will have separate and unrelated correct combinations.
