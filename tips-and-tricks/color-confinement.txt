QCD (quantum-coraldynamics) is used to create [item=h2o-heart-of-the-sea] via color confinement.

There are 6 quarkals:
    - [item=h2o-top-coral]
    - [item=h2o-bottom-coral]
    - [item=h2o-up-coral]
    - [item=h2o-down-coral]
    - [item=h2o-strange-coral]
    - [item=h2o-charm-coral]

Each of these are combined in the [entity=h2o-quantum-computer].
There are 2^6-1 = 63 diffrent possible combinations.

The correct combination is randomized and unknown. It must be determined by an experiment.
To preform an experiment, add your quarkals to the [entity=h2o-quantum-computer] and provide 50 [fluid=chlorine] to catalyze it.
During a correct experiment a [item=h2o-heart-of-the-sea] is created and the secret combination will re-randomize.

The correct combination can be represented as a binary number where each quarkal is a bit.
For example if the secret was 101100 then the correct combination would be [item=h2o-top-coral] [item=h2o-up-coral] [item=h2o-down-coral].
A failed experiment will generate some data about this hidden bit representation.

[item=h2o-top-coral]:
    You have matched more bits than the previous experiment.

[item=h2o-bottom-coral]:
    You have matched less bits than the previous experiment.

[item=limestone]:
    You have matched the same amount of bits as the previous experiment.
    Limestone is always returned during the first experiment.

Note that a combination of 000000 is impossible.
Multiple [entity=h2o-quantum-computer] will have seperate and unrelated correct combinations.
